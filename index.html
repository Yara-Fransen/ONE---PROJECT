      <div id="intro">‘One event, one week, one news channel’ is a re-reading by Yara Fransen of the book Hoarder Order by Thomas Kuijpers. In his work he investigates the question ‘What is the effect on our brain of the daily news reporting, when it comes to terrorism, refugees, Europe, extremism, etc?’. He does this through collecting all kind of material (newspapers, fragments of conversations, comments on Twitter etc.) related to an event. By collecting and analyzing he gets insights into the way in which narratives about specific subjects are shaped. For this website Yara Fransen dived into Kuijpers’ approach and working process. She focused on one event, The Capitol Protest/Riots in Washington DC, USA, that took place January 6, 2021. She collected all headlines from one week after the event (January 7 - 13) posted by Fox News Channel. In just 7 days 282 updates/articles we’re posted on their website related to this event. In this website the constant stream of news and the language of headlines is emphasized.</div>
