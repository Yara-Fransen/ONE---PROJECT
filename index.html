      <div id="intro">‘One event, one week, one news channel’ is a re-reading of the book Hoarder Order by Thomas Kuijpers. In the book he raises the question ‘What is the effect on our brain of the daily news reporting, when it comes to terrorism, refugees, Europe, extremism, etc?’. He investigates this through collecting all kind of material (newspapers, fragments of conversations, comments on Twitter etc.) related to an event. For this website I focused on The Capitol Protest/Riots, that took place the 6th of January 2021. An event that the world was able follow step by step on live streams. I collected all headlines from one week after the event (Jan 7 - Jan 13) posted by Fox News Channel. In just one week 282 updates/articles were posted.</div>
